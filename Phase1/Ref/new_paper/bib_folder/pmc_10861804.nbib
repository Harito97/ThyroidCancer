AB  - Thyroid nodules (TNs) are prevalent and found in up to 50% of individuals. While 
      most TNs are benign, some can be malignant. The evaluation of TNs is crucial to 
      rule out malignancy and identify those requiring surgical intervention. This 
      study aimed to clarify the reported prevalence of TNs, focusing specifically on 
      their various types, assessment and diagnostic processes, current evaluation 
      methods, and evidence-based management. It also provides recommendations for 
      follow-up. TNs are typically found during physical exams or incidentally during 
      imaging procedures. Routine laboratory and clinical evaluations of TNs are 
      common. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging method to determine if a TN needs a 
      biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is crucial in deciding whether surgery or 
      surveillance is necessary. TNs that show suspicious features on the ultrasound 
      may require cytologic analysis to assess the risk of malignancy. The 
      effectiveness of several supplementary molecular tests is still uncertain, 
      although some studies report promising results. The management and treatment 
      approach for TNs primarily depends on the results of FNA cytology and ultrasound 
      characteristics. The optimal treatment strategy for TNs ranges from 
      straightforward follow-ups for low-risk cases to surgical intervention for 
      high-risk patients. Rather than adopting a uniform approach, clinicians should 
      assess each patient on a case-by-case basis using current knowledge and a 
      collaborative, multidisciplinary method.
